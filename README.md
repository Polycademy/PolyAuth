PolyAuth
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Polycademy/PolyAuth.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Polycademy/PolyAuth)

PolyAuth is a PHP authentication and authorisation library that is independent from any frameworks and any databases.

NOTE: This library is not yet ready for prime time! Still need to fix some bugs. If you find any, make sure to tell me on the issues. But it's being actively worked on.

Dependencies
------------

- PHP >= 5.4.12
- PDO + MySQL or any storage adapter
- leighmacdonald/php_rbac
- ircmaxell/password-compat
- PHPMailer/PHPMailer
- php-fig/log
- tedivm/stash

Features
---------

- User Account Management (includes account bans) - Make sure your identity is unique, if you're using the identity as the display name, don't allow duplicate display names. You can mix up usernames and emails, so that emails are identitities and usernames are display names.
- Role Based Access Control at NIST Level 1
- Password Encryption based on Bcrypt
- Automatic Emailing for Activation and Forgotten Identity/Password (can be turned off and used manually (SMTP/mail support))
- Utilisation of loggers that support the PSR log interface
- Automatic Session Handling (with optional encryption) based on PHP sessions. You can extend it from EncryptedSessionHandler or implement your own SessionHandlerInterface
- Manipulation of the session object such as adding in a shopping cart.
- File locks on the session file are automatically resolved by closing the handle immediately. This prevents AJAX race conditions.
- PSR 1 Compatible and Framework Independent
- PDO based Database Queries (only MySQL atm) (if using Codeigniter use $this->db->conn_id)
- Logging in & Logging out
- Optional login throttling based on exponential timeouts (timeout = 1.8^(number of attempts-1)), this can be set to ip address, login identity or both. There are advantages and disadvantages to using each.
- Autologin using a range of authentication strategies.
- SQL and Codeigniter Migrations
- Configurable Language for Returned Errors
- Error handling through exceptions that extend from "PolyAuthException"
- Highly Configurable User Data/Profile
- Password Complexity Checks
- Excellent Random Token Generator
- Authentication Strategy Interface Server Side Implementation - Can be used for HTTP Basic, Cookie, OAuth 1 & 2 Consumer Access Delegation, OAuth 2 Provider, and OpenID. (HTTP Digest is not supported due to its crytographic constraints)
- Unit tested with Continuous Integration at Travis so you can trust that it works!
- Optional caching library involving APC or Filesystem. It's also extendable with the caching interface.
- Supports storage adapters for Database Independent Functionality

To Do
------

- Add OAuth consumption, OpenID consumption, Hawk and Oz authentication strategies
- SQL Migration
- Add OAuth2 provision

Install with Composer
---------------------

```
"polycademy/polyauth": "*"
```

Notes
-----

This does not do filtering or validation of data input. You still need to do this to prevent any problems. This does not do CSRF checks. I do not consider that to be part of a user authentication system. This also does not force you or check for SSL, that should be your job!
